# KlonServicePost
The goal of this tests is to write code for an API created and available inside Bell organisation. The API is used to define a new service-instance as part of the Klondike project. The API uses token authentication.

You don't have access to the API to test as this is an internal API only available at Bell. Ask as many question as you need on the slack channel do get the information you need.

# Test instructions
1. Write code that will do a post against the service-instances route for creating a service
2. Commit and push your code and unit tests (push to your own branch)
3. Create pull request of the final code/branch
